### Project Introduction
MobileNetV1, known for its efficiency and portability, is a popular choice for mobile and edge computing. However, when dealing with specific datasets like CIFAR10, there's room for optimization to achieve better accuracy and efficiency. This project focuses on fine-tuning and optimizing MobileNetV1 specifically for the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

### Modifications and Optimizations
* Architecture Adjustments: Minor changes in the network architecture to better fit the CIFAR10 dataset.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Extensive experimentation with learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters.
* Data Augmentation Techniques: Implementing various data augmentation methods to improve model generalization.
* Regularization Strategies: Applying dropout and other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
